I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at Stanford University, where my research focuses on fairness, bias, and evaluation in large language models. I study how algorithmic evaluation frameworks can fail under social ambiguity and distributional shift, with an emphasis on LLM-as-Judge systems, multi-agent evaluation, and human-aligned benchmarking.

I have conducted research in both academic and industry settings, including work at Adobe Research and Amazon Robotics, and have collaborated with researchers in university labs on responsible and trustworthy AI.

I have been supported by competitive fellowships and scholarships and have held leadership roles in technical and community-focused organizations. Alongside my research, I have founded and led initiatives centered on mentorship, access to computing education, and professional development for underrepresented students.

Research Interests
======
My research interests lie at the intersection of fairness, evaluation, and alignment in large language and multimodal models. I focus on understanding how existing evaluation paradigms fail to capture socially grounded harms, particularly in settings involving ambiguity, subjective judgment, and real-world deployment across text, vision, and multimodal inputs.

About Me
======

Outside of my academic work, I enjoy traveling and exploring new cultures, particularly through cooking and trying cuisines from different regions. I am an avid consumer of murder-mystery media and have a broad interest in music, including learning piano as a novice player. Beyond personal hobbies, I am deeply interested in education reform and initiatives aimed at increasing representation and access in STEM fields.
